# Intelligent-Assembly-Detector
This project focuses on the real-time detection of needle cage bearings on the Tata Motors Jamshedpur assembly line, where high-speed production makes manual inspection infeasible. We use YOLOv8 for object detection and a Python Tkinter GUI for a lightweight, interactive interface.

🔍 Goal: Automate bearing detection to enhance speed and accuracy in industrial assembly.
🧠 Tech Stack: YOLOv8 (for detection) + Python Tkinter (for GUI).
🎥 Demo Video: Live testing conducted at Tata Motors Jamshedpur.
🔐 Note: Model weights are not shared publicly due to confidentiality.
📄 Supporting Docs: Includes patent initiation email and Letter of Recommendation (LOR) from our professor.
